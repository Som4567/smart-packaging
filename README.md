BLE technology to provide a smart and anti-theft packaging solution to the customer.

It is a very common scenario wherein the materials in transit are prone to misplacement or theft.
Therefore the security of the materials is challenged.Even the tamper-indicating seals do not gurantee 100% security.

I have proposed a lock based on BLE to the customers and complet working prototype. 
The BLE based lock provides various advantages like:-

1)It can prevent and log any activity of tampering/unauthorized access with the materials in transit.
2)Geo-Fencing :- Unlocking can happen only in the predefined geo-location
3)Easy to find/search a particular box in the warehouse.

It is easy to integrate e-lock/BLE lock with any ERP or mobile application.
I have put up the dashboard that was designed for this purpose.
